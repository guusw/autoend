# ThousandtyOne AutoEnd (A Quick Way To Place Semi Colons @ End Of Line)
This Extension Automatically inserts the semi-colons on the right place and wraps your code to the next line the moment you type the semi-colon key on your keyboard.

## Features

Quickly and automatically moves semi-colons to the end of line just by hitting the ; key on your keyboard.
For example:

>**Console.WriteLine("Test";)**  

**Automatically** becomes:

>**Console.WriteLine("Test");**

And also automatically moves your cursor to the next line.

Works best with Visual Studio C# Extension, or any extension which automatically closes bracks and quotes. So the typing experience is:

> **Console.Writeline("Test;**

Which Automatically Produces:

> **Console.WriteLine("Test");**

When the extension moves the semi-colon to the end of the line it also moves your cursor to the next line, thereby making your typing very fluid without having to manually put semi-colons explictly at the end of each line or even having to hit the enter key to move to the next line.

> **Note**: You can override automtic move to new line after semi-colon. Use autoend.autoInsertNewline in VS Code settings to control how autoend automically inserts a new line and moves you to the new line. Default behavior is to automtically move to new line.

The Extension understands context of the code in which it executes; so semi-colons will not move to end of line automatically for, 'for' or 'foreach' loops!
